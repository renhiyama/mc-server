## Notice

By running the server, you accept the licenses of every mods inside `mods` folder, and you accept both the license and EULA of Minecraft and hosting a server.

## Starting on Windows:

Run the `start.ps1` file

## Starting on Linux/MacOS:

Run the `./start.sh` file

## Port Forwarding?

Try out tailscale!

## License?

It's free to copy and share! Just accept the licenses and stuff of the mods itself. I dont own any of the mods nor minecraft game itself. I just compiled the list of mods and server stuff.
